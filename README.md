Different RL Agents to Control the universal quantum gate set {H, T , CNOT}

* Gates: H, T, CNOT
* Agents: DQN, DDDQN, REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, A3C, ACTOR-CRITIC...
* Hamiltonians: Field, Rotational, Geometric, Composite...
* Fidelity: Gate (Trace between the target gate abd the U accumulated propagator)
* Pulse type: Discrete actions over Rabi Frequency, Detuning, and Coupling Strengh
