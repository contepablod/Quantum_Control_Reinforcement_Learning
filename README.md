# Quantum_Control_Reinforcement_Learning

Different RL Agents to Control the universal quantum gate set {H, T , CNOT}

* Gates: H, T, CNOT
* Agents: DDDQN, PPO, GRPO, TD3
* Hamiltonians: Field (Rabi Frequency, Detuning, Coupling Strength)
* Fidelity:  Process and Average Process Fidelity (Trace between the target gate and the U accumulated propagator)
* Pulse type: Discrete and Continuous actions over Rabi Frequency, Detuning, and Coupling Strengh
