## **Abstract**

The design and implementation of universal quantum gate sets are foundational to the ad-
vancement of quantum computing, enabling the realization of complex quantum algorithms
and error correction protocols. This thesis explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods to efficiently construct a universal quantum gate set comprising the Hadamard (H),
the π-8 (T), and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. These gates, recognized for their minimality
and universality, serve as essential building blocks for arbitrary quantum operations.


The problem is formulated as a control optimization task, where various RL agents are
deployed to determine the optimal Rabi Frequency, Detuning and coupling strength timing
of quantum pulses to implement these gates with high fidelity. The investigation includes
an evaluation of multiple reinforcement learning algorithms to assess their performance in
balancing computational efficiency, physical constraints, and scalability across single- and
multi-qubit systems.


The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating the
ability of RL techniques to automate and enhance the design of universal gate sets. This
work contributes to the growing synergy between machine learning and quantum technolo-
gies, offering a flexible and scalable framework for optimizing quantum control. The findings
highlight the potential of RL-based methodologies in advancing practical and robust imple-
mentations of quantum computing.
